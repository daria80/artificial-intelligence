<h3 style="color:black">A new AI tool could help reveal the structure of the universe, the scientists who created it have said.

    The technology could help us "work our way towards uncovering the greatest mystery of modern physics, which is to uncover what dark energy is", according to the lead author of a study detailing the breakthrough.

    Astronomers have long been searching for a full picture of the universe. That has brought major breakthroughs as researchers have looked more deeply and in more detail at the universe than ever before.


    But researchers continue to run up against the problem of dark matter and dark energy, which makes up most of the universe but can only be observed indirectly. Nobody has been able to understand its nature or how it fits into any possible model of the cosmos.

    Some scientists have hoped to move towards solving this problem with a greater understanding of the structure of the universe. If astronomers are able to understand how our cosmos is made up – generating a full picture of the filaments where galaxies cluster together, and the voids that appear to be empty – then they may be able to give a better picture of what it is made of, and how it works.</h3>
