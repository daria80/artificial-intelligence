<h1><div class ="text"><h3 style="color: black">PENTAGON PREPARES TO ACCELERATE USE OF AI IN WAR BY ADOPTING ‘ETHICAL PRINCIPLES’</h3></div></h1>
<h3 style="color:black">The US Department of Defense has announced plans to adopt ethical principles to push forward with the use of artificial intelligence within warfare.

    The Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, said the five AI principles would lay the foundation for "the ethical design, development, deployment, and the use of AI by the Department of Defense".

    The new principles call for people to "exercise appropriate levels of judgment and care" when deploying and using AI systems, such as those that scan aerial imagery to look for targets.


    They also say decisions made by automated systems should be "traceable" and "governable," which means "there has to be a way to disengage or deactivate" them if they are demonstrating unintended behavior, said Air Force Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan, director of the Pentagon's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.

    The Pentagon's push to speed up its AI capabilities has fueled a fight between tech companies over a $10 billion cloud computing contract known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. Microsoft won the contract in October but hasn't been able to get started on the 10-year project because Amazon sued the Pentagon, arguing that President Donald Trump's antipathy toward Amazon and its chief executive Jeff Bezos hurt the company's chances at winning the bid.</h3>
